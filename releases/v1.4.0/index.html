                <h1 id="amy-release-v140">AMY release v1.4.0</h1>
<p>Intense month of January is almost behind us, so it's time for new AMY release.</p>
<p>Three versions have been released since <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.3">v1.3.0</a>: <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.3.1">v1.3.1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.3.2">v1.3.2</a>
(both in separate release notes files) and finally <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.4">v1.4.0</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the way we have our project laid out on GitHub, some of
the features implemented for <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.4">v1.4.0</a> before <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v1.3.2">v1.3.2</a> were included in
the deployment; I will still put them here, though.</p>
<p>The biggest highlights of this month are definitely:</p>
<ul>
<li>first approach to the new API</li>
<li>API reports</li>
<li>merging events.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also some essential features, but not much. In v1.5 there will be
a lot more.</p>
<h2 id="data-fixing">Data fixing</h2>
<p>We had to programmatically fix/complete some of our records:</p>
<ul>
<li>historical events on production server were assigned an administering
  organization (that's the one responsible for taking care of the workshop
  bureaucracy),</li>
<li>new DC instructors were added: anyone with a special note or anyone who
  taught at DC workshop now has a <code>DC instructor</code> badge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="new-features">New features</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>Person</code> model is now able to store person's occupation and ORCID code,</li>
<li>events can hold links to survey results (pre-workshop for learners and for
  instructors, post-workshop for learners and for instructors, and long-term
  for learners),</li>
<li>API call for getting members list is now for logged in users only, and
  returns members' usernames too,</li>
<li>merging events: with option to select fields from either of events, or (in
  some cases) even to combine them together. The underlying code may be
  reused to fix persons merging,</li>
<li>workshop issues page now allows to filter workshops by assigned admin</li>
<li>move most of reports to the API; 3 reports now present a graph for easy use,
  1 report was requested to be moved to API, and 1 new report was requested
  (and <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz">Piotr</a> made it in API),</li>
<li>API: new structure. It's using hyperlinks between resources and allows to
  view and filter for example people associated with specific events,</li>
<li>slow tests were fixed (we gained probably around 10s on whole test suite,
  even though about 10-20 new tests were introduced); now it's time to speed up
  migrations,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gvwilson">Greg</a> added two new badges to the database: maintainer and trainer; <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz">Piotr</a> made
  sure to allow for editing badges via Django Admin interface, and also added
  these new badges to the fake database command,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gvwilson">Greg</a> also added a new command for getting list of people who should be warned
  because their instructor training was about to close,</li>
<li>meanwhile <a href="https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz">Piotr</a> added a command for displaying report about instructor training
  completion rates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>some fields containing numerical values were switched to other type of fields
  to prevent slider from appearing; the background for this issue was that
  when scrolling through a page with form, on MacOSX people would accidentally
  change values of numerical fields,</li>
<li>generation of initial revisions was added to the process of creating a fake
  database for development use,</li>
<li>some types of events (<code>stalled</code> and <code>unresponsive</code>) were kicked out from
  debrief lookup,</li>
<li>some invoice options were changed to remain consistent with the rest.</li>
</ul>
